## ðŸš€ Technologies

This project was developed with the following technologies:

- HTML and CSS
- JavaScript
- Git and Github

## ðŸ’» Project

I searched for a free web development course on march, 2023. i was afraid it wouldnt workout because its a whole new area that i never touched. Gladly i finished the course in one week and i had a solid material that gave me motivation and faith in changing carrer. So, this linktree was created to use as business card and portfolio which i intend to update with every new skill that this next phase of my life provides.
